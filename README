    csvutil - CSV data utilities for the Go programming language.

VERSION

    This is csutil version 0.0_6

SYNOPSIS

    The csvutil package can be used to read CSV data from any io.Reader.

        package main
        import "github.com/bmatsuo/csvutil"

        func main() {
            reader := csvutil.NewReader(os.Stdin)
            reader.Trim = true
            writer := csvutil.NewWriter(os.Stdout)
            for r := range reader.EachRow() {
                if r.Error != nil {
                    panic(r.Error)
                }
                write.WriteFieldsln(r)
            }
        }

ABOUT

    The csvutil package is written to make interacting with CSV data as
    easy as possible. Efficiency of its underlying functions and methods
    are less important factors in its design. However, that being said,
    csvutil should be capable of handling very large streams of CSV data
    fairly well in terms of speed and memory usage.

FEATURES

    Slurping and spewing CSV data. That is, reading/writing whole
    files/data streams at once.

    Iteration through individual rows of a CSV data stream for a smaller
    memory footprint.

    Writing of individual writing fields/rows as well as batch writing.

TODO

    Iteration of individual fields from a CSV data stream with a flag that
    indicates new rows.

    Formatted reading/writing of CSV data.

INSTALL

    The easiest installation of csvutil is done through goinstall.

        goinstall github.com/bmatsuo/csvutil
