    csvutil - ...like hitting CSV data with a sledgehammer made of pure Go.

VERSION

    This is csutil version 0.2_4

SYNOPSIS

    The csvutil package can be used to read CSV data from any io.Reader.

        package main
        import "github.com/bmatsuo/csvutil"

        func main() {
            reader := csvutil.NewReader(os.Stdin)
            reader.Trim = true
            writer := csvutil.NewWriter(os.Stdout)
            rit := reader.RowIterStarted()
            for r := range rit.Rows {
                if r.Error != nil {
                    rit.Break()
                    panic(r.Error)
                }
                write.WriteFieldsln(r)
                rit.Next()
            }
        }

ABOUT

    The csvutil package is written to make interacting with CSV data as
    easy as possible. Efficiency of its underlying functions and methods
    are slightly less important factors in its design. However, that being
    said, it is important. And, csvutil should be capable of handling
    both extremely large and fairly small streams of CSV data through input
    and output quite well in terms of speed and memory footprint. It should
    do this while not making your code bend over backwards (more than
    necessary). As libraries should never make you do.

FEATURES

    Slurping and spewing CSV data. That is, reading/writing whole
    files/data streams at once.

    Iteration through individual rows of a CSV data stream for a smaller
    memory footprint.

    Writing of individual writing fields/rows as well as batch writing.

TODO

    Iteration of individual fields from a CSV data stream with a flag that
    indicates new rows.

    Formatted reading/writing of CSV data.

INSTALL

    The easiest installation of csvutil is done through goinstall.

        goinstall github.com/bmatsuo/csvutil
